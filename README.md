# not-gdpr-spambot
A small script that lets you send lotsa GDPR in-compliant emails from your local machine

Sometimes sending transactional email is not valid and using an email service like MailChimp or Hubspot might not be a possibility, because you want stuff to look good and not be tracked.

## Setup
Just configure the .env file with your settings, add your recipients into the recipients.csv file and write your email content into the email_content.txt file and run the script.

Might require you to pip install some external libraries but didn't write a REQUIREMENTS.TXT so good luck.
